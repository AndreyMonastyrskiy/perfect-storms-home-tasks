    9. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
       Answer:
       - Interface cannot have implementations.
       - Abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.
       - Variables declared in a interface is by default final.
       - Abstract class may contain non-final variables.
       - An interface can extend another interface only.
       - An abstract class can extend another class and implement multiple interfaces.
